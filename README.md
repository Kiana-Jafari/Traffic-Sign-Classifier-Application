### Traffic Sign Classifier Application

Welcome to this project! Traffic Sign Detection is an important concept in enhancing road safety, autonomous vehicles, and driver-assistance systems. Businesses such as transportation safety organizations often work on improving road safety, preventing crashes, and minimizing their impact by assessing road safety from the perspective of all users, including drivers, cyclists, pedestrians, and motorcyclists. In this project, we implemented a convolutional neural network from scratch to automatically classify these signs into predefined categories and deployed the model using Streamlit. Please note that the notebook has a research-educational, yet industrial purpose. The aim is to build a convolutional neural network from scratch, train it on a slightly different version of the original dataset and the architecture, and replicate the author's work.
